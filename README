# X2V

X2V is a PHP Script & XSLT script to convert microformats found in webpages into other forms. It was originally written to convert hCard and hCalendar to their respected native forms; vcard .VCF and iCalendar .ICS files.

The mechanisms of X2V are now capable of supporting other conversions too, such as hCard to RDF.

This is a starting point for anyone wanting to extract microformats from pages.
